This IT industry is changing so rapidly that there are new ways of authentication coming .

These days companies are adding new ways of authentication so frequently to make it easier for user to use and for developer easy to create. Now they have strip down to magic link authentication (used by [Slack](https://slack.com)) in which just have to enter the email address and you will be authenticated by clicking the "magic link" sent to your email. Now the user don't have to remember the email address and for developer they don't have to validate the email address. 

There is new way of authentication, I found while logging though [now](https://zeit.co/now) cli. Below is the gif for that
