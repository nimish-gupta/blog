Here is a list of some git shortcuts so that it can save some time during development.

#### Add the below changes to the gitconfig file

All the listed below shortcuts are done by changing in the `gitconfig` file. This file is by default is located in the home directory. To edit the git config file, open bash/shell and write

`git config -e --global` .

Here is a copy of my git config file

```powershell
# This is Git's per-user configuration file.
[user]
	name = Nimish # user name for the git commit
	email = nimishgupta18396@gmail.com # email address for the git commit
[alias]
	co = checkout
	br = branch
	bc = checkout -b
	st = status
	last = log -1 HEAD
	all = add -A
	cm = commit -m
	ph = push origin HEAD
    pl = pull origin HEAD
	plo = pull origin
	pho = push origin
    ss = stash
    ssa = stash apply
	rom = rebase -i origin/master
	ro = rebase -i
	fo = fetch origin
	fom = fetch origin master
    rc = rebase --continue
	ra = rebase --abort

[filter "lfs"]
	clean = git-lfs clean -- %f
	smudge = git-lfs smudge -- %f
	process = git-lfs filter-process
	required = true
```

To use any of the above command just use `git <command-name>` like

`git co` - It will checkout from the current branch.

`git br` - It will list out all the branches.

`git bc new-branch-name` - It will create a new branch.

`git st`- It will show the current status.

`git last`- It will show the last commit message.

`git all` - It will add all the files for committing.

`git cm <commit-message>`- It will add the message while doing the git commit.

`git ph` - It will push to the current branch to the remote origin on which you will be working on. Like if you are working on the `new-feature` branch and if you type `git ph` it will push to the `new-feature` branch.

`git pl` - It will pull to the current branch from the remote origin on which you will be working on.

`git plo <branch-name>` - It will pull from the branch name.

`git pho <branch-name>` - It will push to the branch name.

`git ss` - It will stash the changes.

`git ssa` - It will reset the last stash applied changes.

`git rom` - It will perform rebase from the master branch.

`git rc` - It will continue the rebase operation after resolving the conflicts.

`git ra`- It will abort the rebase operation.

#### Add the following changes to the .bashrc file

You can further reduce the git commands by replacing `git` with `g`. For this, you have to add aliasing in the configuration file of your system.

Also, you can add some functions which can be further used to save some time.

Add the following aliasing and functions to your respective config files according to your terminal.

```powershell
alias g=git

function grll () { git branch  | while read b; do git log --color --format="%ci _%C(magenta)%cr %C(bold cyan)$b%Creset %s %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset" $b | head -n 1; done | sort -r | cut -d_ -f2- | sed 's;origin/;;g' }
function grlr () { git branch -r  | while read b; do git log --color --format="%ci _%C(magenta)%cr %C(bold cyan)$b%Creset %s %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset" $b | head -n 1; done | sort -r | cut -d_ -f2- | sed 's;origin/;;g' }
function grls () { git log --pretty=format:"- %s %h" "$@"; }
```

Above functions perform following operations:-

`grls` - To show the difference between the tags for release body.

`grlo` - This will bring the logs of recent done changes in the local branches.

`grlr` - This will bring the logs of recent done changes in the local and remote branches.

Above functions are handy, when you are simultaneously working on many branches, and you want to know the name of the branch in which you have committed some days ago.

And then restart your terminal.
