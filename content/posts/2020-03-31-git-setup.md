Here is a list of some git shortcuts so that it can save some time during development.

All the listed below shortcuts are done by changing in the `gitconfig` file. This file is by default is located in the home directory. To edit the git config file, open bash/shell and write

`git config -e --global` .

Here is a copy of my git config file

```powershell
# This is Git's per-user configuration file.
[user]
	name = Nimish # user name for the git commit
	email = nimishgupta18396@gmail.com # email address for the git commit
[alias]
	co = checkout
	br = branch
	bc = checkout -b
	st = status
	last = log -1 HEAD
	all = add -A
	cm = commit -m
	ph = push origin HEAD
    pl = pull origin HEAD
	plo = pull origin
	pho = push origin
    ss = stash
    ssa = stash apply
	pr = pull-request
	rom = rebase -i origin/master
	ro = rebase -i
	fo = fetch origin
	fom = fetch origin master
    rc = rebase --continue
	ra = rebase --abort

[filter "lfs"]
	clean = git-lfs clean -- %f
	smudge = git-lfs smudge -- %f
	process = git-lfs filter-process
	required = true
```

To use any of the above command just use `git <command-name>` like

`git co` - It will checkout from the current branch.

`git br` - It will list out all the branches.

`git bc new-branch-name` - It will create a new branch.

`git st`- It will show the current status.

`git last`- It will show the last commit message.

`git all` - It will add all the files for commiting.

`git cm <commit-message>`- It will add the message while doing the git commit.

`git ph` - It will push to the current branch to the remote origin on which you will be working on. Like if you are working on the `new-feature` branch and if you type `git ph` it will push to the `new-feature` branch.

`git pl` - It will pull to the current branch from the remote origin on which you will be working on.

`git plo <branch-name>` - It will pull from the branch name.

`git pho <branch-name>` - It will push to the branch name.

`git ss` - It will stash the changes.

`git ssa` - It will reset the last stash applied changes.

`git rom` - It will perform rebase from the master branch.

`git rc` - It will continue the rebase operation after resolving the conflicts.

`git ra`- It will abort the rebase operation.
