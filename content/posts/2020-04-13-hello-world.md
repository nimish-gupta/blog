Hey all,

Thanks for coming on this blog :)

This one is a long due thing which I was thinking since the beginning of time. Thanks to a friend (@Ayush Jaiswal) who suggested the book [Eat the Frog](https://www.amazon.in/That-Frog-Great-Ways-Procrastinating/dp/1576754227) which leads in starting this blog.

## About me

![Coding](/media/coding.jpg)

I'm Nimish Gupta. A Software Engineer, currently working at an amazing company called Pesto. Here I have worked as a Software Engineer from last 3 years. In the company, I have worked on a couple of languages/frameworks/databases/environments. I like to automate stuff and program deliberately.

I have experience in various trending technologies such as **React, Reasonml, Typescript, Serverless, Docker, Node and ...**. Feel free to check out my [Github](https://github.com/nimish-gupta),  [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nimish-gupta) or [my portfolio](https://portfolio.nimish-gupta.dev) for more examples of my work.

The reason I have started this blog was to improve my writing skills (especially technical writing skills) and learn how to express programming and give back to the community. There is this Chinese saying,

> If you want happiness for an hour, take a nap. If you want happiness for a day, go fishing. If you want happiness for a year, inherit a fortune. If you want happiness for a lifetime, help somebody.

Also, [this](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/) blog from \[@swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx) explains multiple benefits of writing in public which really inspired me to start this blog.
